Our application is a simple interface that retrieves specific wine data from some store websites with webscraping technology.
For the Dashboard in which the user navigates and sees the results, we used streamlit framework.
We used Python to search and get the mandatory data and we've made use of a MySQL Database to store it and to redirect it to our Dashboard.

It will be a user-friendly platform with great scalability...
