The problem that was given to us for this Hackathon was to implement a web scraping system capable of collecting wine prices from national online stores.
We've decided to approach this problem by dividing it in three main parts:
  - Web Scraping Implementation capable of collecting wine prices from online stores.
  - Creating a comprehensive database structure to store the retrieved data.
  - Designing a user-friendly Dashboard to interact with the retrieved data.
We ended up creating an application with a simple interface that retrieves specific wine data from online stores using web scraping technology.
It works by retrieving the data and storing it in a database that we created using MySQL.
We then used Python and SQL queries to search and display the needed data on our Dashboard for easy visualization.
In conclusion, the solution that we've created is a simple and easy to use application that lets you display the wine prices organized by stores and within a certain time frame.
The main highlight our solution is that it can be easily upgraded by adding further features that can be useful for the company using our application.
